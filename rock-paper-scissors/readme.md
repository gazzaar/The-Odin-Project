# Rock Paper Scissors

- Rock Paper Scissors game, play it with computer for five times and the that has a higher score wins.
- This was the first JS project from TOP

- [ðŸ‘‰Live demo](https://gazzaar.github.io/The-Odin-Project/rock-paper-scissors)

#### What I have learned from this Project ?

- Working with functions that takes another function as a parameter
- Return random value form a function
- Handling some bugs "Initial value as needed for the conditions within the function" by making another function get that value and then passing the function as a parameter to the main function
- Working with DOM and handling some buttons as inputs
- Refactor some code for UI
