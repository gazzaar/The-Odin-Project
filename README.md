Small websites from : The Odin Project

- In TOP curriculum the instructions is to make one repo for every project but I decided to make one big repo for the small projects like the ones in the HTML,CSS and may bo also some of the JavaScript projects because I feel it's unnecessary to end up have many repos and some of them are just small website
